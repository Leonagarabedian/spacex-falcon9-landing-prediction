# Data Wrangling: Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing booster landing outcomes to uncover patterns and insights. Our primary goal is to analyze the various landing results and define a clear label for training supervised machine learning models.

The dataset includes different scenarios where the booster either successfully landed or failed to do so. For instance:
- True Ocean: Booster successfully landed in a specific ocean region
- False Ocean: Booster unsuccessfully landed in the ocean
- True RTLS: Booster successfully landed on a ground pad
- False RTLS: Booster unsuccessfully landed on a ground pad
- True ASDS: Booster successfully landed on a drone ship
- False ASDS: Booster unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship

Simplify these outcomes into binary training labels:
- 1: Successful landing
- 0: Unsuccessful landing

# Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on booster landing data
- Define binary training labels based on landing success
