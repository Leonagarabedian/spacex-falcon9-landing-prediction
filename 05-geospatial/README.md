# Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium: SpaceX Launch Sites
## Project Description

Exploring the geographic and spatial factors that may influence the success rates of SpaceX rocket launches. Launch success depends on many variables, including payload mass, orbit type, and crucially, the location and proximities of the launch sites themselves.

Building on earlier exploratory data analysis (EDA) using static visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn, this project leverages the power of **Folium** to create interactive maps that visualize launch sites and their success or failure history. This interactive approach allows for deeper geographic insights that are not easily captured with static charts.

Using this project, you will:

- **Identify and map all SpaceX launch sites on a geographic map.**
- **Visualize individual launch outcomes (success or failure) for each site, providing a spatial context to the data.**
- **Calculate and display distances from launch sites to nearby geographical features or points of interest, helping to understand proximity impacts.**

The goal is to discover meaningful geographic patterns that might explain or contribute to launch success rates and assist in determining optimal locations for future launch sites.

## What You Will Learn

- How to use Folium for interactive spatial visualizations in Python.
- Techniques to map geospatial data points and customize markers based on attributes (e.g., success/failure).
- Calculating distances between geographic points to analyze spatial relationships.
- Understanding how geographic factors potentially impact space launch outcomes.
