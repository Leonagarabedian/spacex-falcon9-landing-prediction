# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description

In this project, you will build a machine learning pipeline to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. SpaceX advertises significant cost savings by reusing the first stage of their rockets, priced at $62 million per launch compared to $165 million or more by other providers. Predicting first stage landing outcomes can provide valuable insights for competitors and stakeholders aiming to understand launch costs and risks.

Building on prior exploratory data analysis, this lab guides you through the complete machine learning workflow â€” from data preparation and feature engineering to training multiple classifiers and evaluating their performance.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis and define training labels.
- Create a binary classification column indicating successful first stage landing.
- Standardize and preprocess the dataset.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train and tune three different classification models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Classification Trees
  - Logistic Regression
- Find the best hyperparameters for each model.
- Compare model performance on test data and identify the best approach.

## What You Will Learn

- Preparing data for machine learning (feature creation, scaling).
- Splitting datasets for training and evaluation.
- Building classification models using SVM, decision trees, and logistic regression.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
- Evaluating model accuracy and making predictions.
