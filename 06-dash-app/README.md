# Interactive SpaceX Launch Dashboard with Plotly Dash

## Project Description

This project is an interactive dashboard application built using **Plotly Dash** that enables users to perform real-time visual analytics on SpaceX launch data. The dashboard provides intuitive input controls: a dropdown menu for selecting launch sites and a range slider for choosing payload mass—to dynamically update visualizations and uncover insights about launch success.

Through this application, users can explore SpaceX’s launch performance across different sites and payload ranges, gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing mission outcomes.

### Key Features

- **Launch Site Dropdown:** Filter and analyze launches from specific SpaceX launch sites.
- **Success Pie Chart:** Visualize the distribution of successful and failed launches for the selected site.
- **Payload Range Slider:** Select payload mass ranges to filter launches dynamically.
- **Success-Payload Scatter Chart:** Explore correlations between payload mass and launch success, including booster version information.

### Insights You Can Discover

- Which launch site has the largest number of successful launches?
- Which site achieves the highest launch success rate?
- What payload mass ranges correspond to the highest and lowest success rates?
- Which Falcon 9 booster versions (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) have the best launch success?

## What You Will Learn

- Building interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash.
- Implementing dynamic callbacks to connect user inputs and visualizations.
- Creating pie charts and scatter plots that respond to real-time user selections.
- Using Python and Dash to explore complex datasets in an accessible format.
